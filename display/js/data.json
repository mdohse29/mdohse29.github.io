At my workplace, our content team frequently transfers content authored in Word into the CMT. Unfortunately, this process often introduces hidden characters and unwanted formatting from the Word document.<br><br>To mitigate these issues, I created this solution to reduce the likelihood of unwanted entities being pasted into the CMT. The tool automatically runs the text through several checks to ensure that no hidden entities or formatting errors are present before the text is entered into the CMT. This simple yet effective tool has significantly reduced the amount of post-entry work required to find, fix, and replace unwanted formatting and entities.",
